# ML-model
Deploy machine learning model in google cloud

1. Open Google cloud platform and open Vertex AI under Artificial Intelligence

2. In the Vertex AI dashboard set up your project and environment by clicking on create dataset

3. Create an image classification dataset and importing images from cloud storage
   (cloud-samples-data/ai-platform/flowers/flowers.csv).Within few minutes your dataset will be loaded and a mail will be sent to you.       

4. Now Training an AutoML image classification model after completion you will get mail.

5. Deploying a model to an endpoint and send a prediction.Give a name to your end model and deploy it.You will recieve a mail that your model is deployed

6. Upload some images and check the working of the model.

7. Cleaning up your project.
